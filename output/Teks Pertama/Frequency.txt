 Have you experienced this before? To be honest, I don't have the answers. Same failure, yet different responses. Who is right and who is wrong? Neither. It was at that point their biggest breakthrough came. It must come from within you. Where are you settling in your life right now? Could you be you playing for bigger stakes than you are? So become intentional on what you want out of life. Commit to it. Nurture your dreams.
